# The Dust Off

The new static home for what was formerly [thedustoff.com](http://thedustoff.com). This site makes the XML feed available as well as a basic stylized version of the feed on the homepage.

## Getting started

To run the site locally, use:

```bash
npm install && npm start
```

From there, you can open the site in your browser at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

## What's up next

This is still an early version, built in one evening care of [Storyteller Lager](https://www.storytellerbeverages.com/) and too much [Creed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J16lInLZRms) - so you can thank them both for this mess.

Stuff that still needs to be done:

- Migrate MP3s from WordPress and DigitalOcean
- Repair audio player elements for each post
- Migrate episode images over from WordPress
- Render full episode details when selected
- Add the show logo and additional details
